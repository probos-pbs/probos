ProBoS was developed by [Craig Macdonald](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm), [@craig_macdonald](https://twitter.com/craig_macdonald) of the [University of Glasgow](http://www.gla.ac.uk/).

Testing, feedback and guidance were gratefully received from Iadh Ounis, Richard McCreadie, Graham McDonald, Stuart Mackie. The name ProBoS was due to inspiration by Saul Vargas - the word probos is a corruption of the Spanish word proboscideo, a cult word for elephant. Probos is also the future tense of probar, "to try out, to attempt, to test".
